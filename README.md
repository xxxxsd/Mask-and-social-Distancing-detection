# Mask-and-social-Distancing-detection
Social distancing, also called “physical distancing,” means keeping a safe space between yourself and other people who are not from your household.
To practice social or physical distancing, stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arm lengths) from other people who are not from your household in both indoor and outdoor spaces.
Objective is to build a Deep Learning model which can identify if the person is wearing a mask or not, also detecting if people violating social distancing norms.
We'll be using a Haar Cascade Model trained to detect faces in order to obtain the bounding box coordinates of faces in an image.
